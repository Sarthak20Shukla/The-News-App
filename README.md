# The News App 🗞

News App is a simple news app 🗞️ which uses [NewsAPI](https://newsapi.org/) to fetch top news headlines from the API. The main aim of this app is to be a leading example of how to build Modern Android applications for all native and hybrid Android Developers

The Code focuses 👓 on following key things:
- Code structuring, style and comments
- Dependency injection 🗡
- Offline first ✈️
- Kotlin + Coroutines + Jetpack Compose

The idea is to keep the app super simple along with proper architecture while demonstrating new libraries and tools which makes it easier to build high quality native Android applications.

# Development Setup 🖥

You will require latest version of Android Studio Chipmunk (or newer) to be able to build the app

## API key 🔑
You'll need to provide API key to fetch the news from the News Service (API). Currently the news is fetched from [NewsAPI](https://newsapi.org/)


## Libraries and tools 🛠

News App uses libraries and tools used to build Modern Android application, mainly part of Android Jetpack 🚀

- [Kotlin](https://kotlinlang.org/) + [Jetpack Compose](https://developer.android.com/jetpack)
- [Coroutines](https://kotlinlang.org/docs/reference/coroutines-overview.html) and [Flow](https://kotlinlang.org/docs/reference/coroutines/flow.html) first
- Architecture components(MVVM + Clean Architecture)
- [Dagger 2](https://developer.android.com/training/dependency-injection) for dependency injection 🗡
- [Retrofit](https://square.github.io/retrofit/) and [Coil Library](https://coil-kt.github.io/coil/)


## Architecture

The app uses MVVM [Model-View-ViewModel] architecture to have a unidirectional flow of data, separation of concern, testability, and a lot more.
